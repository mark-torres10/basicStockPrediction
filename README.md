# Basic Stock Prediction, in Python
Basic attempt at scraping stock information from the web and predicting prices. My goal here was to learn a little bit about web scraping, so that I would be able to use these skills in future projects. 

In this implementation, I scraped stock prices from Yahoo and fitted models to predict the price. Future work could make this a more robust script by allowing command line arguments for the stock of interest and allowing for different types of models to be created. At the moment, there are aspects of this program that are hard-coded, and I would like to make it more dynamic, which requires improved familiarity with web scraping.
