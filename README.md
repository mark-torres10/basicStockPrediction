# Basic Stock Prediction, in Python
Basic attempt at scraping stock information from the web and predicting prices.

In this implementation, I scraped stock prices from Yahoo and fitted models to predict the price. Future work could make this a more robust script by allowing command line arguments for the stock of interest and allowing for different types of models to be created.
